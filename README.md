# Project_TiO2_water_methods_assessment

This project methodology is composed by 4 sequential steps: 

* (i) generation of the nuclear guiding trajectory through Molecular Dynamics (MD); 

* (ii) computation of TD-DFT excitations; 

* (iii) computation of nonadiabatic couplings (NACs);

* (iv) running the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD). In this way, the four directories contain the inputs and scripts required to run each 
step + some key outputs and extra scripts for visualizing some of the results.
